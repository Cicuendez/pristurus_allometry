# Introduction

some general paragraph on the evolution of phenotypic diversity \hfill\break


when organisms colonize new and unique habitats, they are subjected to novel ecological selection pressures in those habitats. Often these selective pressures elicit changes in body form, as organisms adapt to their new habitats (examples: some comment on ecomorphs, etc.).  .... leads to so-called ecomorphs, with such well known examples in Anolis lizards, cichlid fishes, etc.  It follows that ... Some comment on the fact that clades living in diverse ecological conditions often display greater diversity in form and function (REFS).

However, while the above patterns have been well documented in a variety of vertebrate taxa, what remains less known is how allometry plays a role in this phenotypic diversification.  We know that XYZPDQ (about allometry).  Then links to diversity.. 

The Afro-Arabian geckos in the genus *Pristurus* afford the opportunity to elucidate the interdigitating effects of allometry and habitat specialization on clade-level patterns of phenotypic diversity. Prior work on this system [@Tejero-Cicuendez2021] has revealed that ... (sentence or 2 about your prior study, getting to diversity and ... Importantly, ... something about habitat.  .... What remains unexamined however, is XYZPDQ...

# Materials and Methods

## Data

Phylogenetic, ecological, phenotypic.... (describe briefly). Data from [@Tejero-Cicuendez2021]. 

## Statistical Analyses

To test the hypothesis...

- Mancova body ~ SVL*hab.gp
  - PW of slopes, and inspected reg. coefficients to identify biological trends
  - Visualized multivariate regressions via regression scores [sensu @DrakeKlingenberg2008] and predicted lines [sensu @AdamsNistri2010] 
- Examine allometry phylogenetically. 
  - PLS of head vs. SVL and limb vs SVL.  Obtained scores on 1st axis for each.
  - within-species regressions of Head.sc ~ SVL & limb.sc ~ SVL; obtained regression coefficients (slopes)
  - mapped slopes on phylogeny under BM and generated traitgrams to identify changes in allometric relationships across the phylogeny
- Finally, to link allometric patterns with trends in phenotypic diversification we obtained size-standardized species means, following procedures in H TC paper (residuals from phylo-regressions of traits on SVL, residuals). We then performed an ordination to obtain a phylomorphospace, where habitat types and species could be observed.

# Figures

Figure 1. Linear Measurements used in this study. SVL = snout-vent length, TL = trunk length, HL = head length, HW = head width, HH = head height, Lhu = humerus length, Lun = ulna length, Lfe = femur length, Ltb = tibia length [for details see @Tejero-Cicuendez2021]. \hfill\break

Figure 2. Plot of regression scores and predicted lines representing the relationship between linear body measurements and size (SVL). Individuals re colored by habitat use: rock (beige), ground (dark purple), and tree (magenta).  \hfill\break

Figure 3. Traitgrams showing the evolution of body size (SVL) through time based on the phylogenetic tree of *Pristurus*. Colors represent an evolutionary mapping of regression slopes describing the relationship of (A) head morphology versus body size, and (B) limb proportions versus body size (see text for descriptions). Species names are colored by habitat use: rock (beige), ground (dark purple), and tree (magenta). \hfill\break

Figure 4. Phylomorphospace of *Pristurus*, based on residuals from a phylogenetic regression of body measurements on size (SVL). Species means are colored by habitat use: rock (beige), ground (dark purple), and tree (magenta). Large and small rock-dwelling and ground-dwelling are highlighted with darker colors to highlight their differentiation and relative positions in morphospace.
