# Introduction

some general paragraph on the evolution of phenotypic diversity \hfill\break


when organisms colonize new and unique habitats, they are subjected to novel ecological selection pressures in those habitats. Often these selective pressures elicit changes in body form, as organisms adapt to their new habitats (examples: some comment on ecomorphs, etc.).  .... leads to so-called ecomorphs, with such well known examples in Anolis lizards, cichlid fishes, etc.  It follows that ... Some comment on the fact that clades living in diverse ecological conditions often display greater diversity in form and function (REFS).

However, while the above patterns have been well documented in a variety of vertebrate taxa, what remains less known is how allometry plays a role in this phenotypic diversification.  We know that XYZPDQ (about allometry).  Then links to diversity.. 

The Afro-Arabian geckos in the genus *Pristurus* afford the opportunity to elucidate the interdigitating effects of allometry and habitat specialization on clade-level patterns of phenotypic diversity. Prior work on this system [@Tejero-Cicuendez2021] has revealed that ... (sentence or 2 about your prior study, getting to diversity and ... Importantly, ... something about habitat.  .... What remains unexamined however, is XYZPDQ...

# Materials and Methods

## Data

Phylogenetic, ecological, phenotypic.... (describe briefly). Data from [@Tejero-Cicuendez2021]. 

## Statistical Analyses

To test the hypothesis...

- Mancova body ~ SVL*hab.gp
  - PW of slopes, and inspected reg. coefficients to identify biological trends
  - Visualized multivariate regressions via regression scores [sensu @DrakeKlingenberg2008] and predicted lines [sensu @AdamsNistri2010] 
- Examine allometry phylogenetically. 
  - PLS of head vs. SVL and limb vs SVL.  Obtained scores on 1st axis for each.
  - within-species regressions of Head.sc ~ SVL & limb.sc ~ SVL; obtained regression coefficients (slopes)
  - mapped slopes on phylogeny under BM and generated traitgrams to identify changes in allometric relationships across the phylogeny
- Finally, to link allometric patterns with trends in phenotypic diversification we obtained size-standardized species means, following procedures in H TC paper (residuals from phylo-regressions of traits on SVL, residuals). We then performed an ordination to obtain a phylomorphospace, where habitat types and species could be observed.
