\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Understanding how phenotypic diversity evolves, and elucidating the
forces that generate and maintain this diversity, are major goals in
evolutionary biology. Because adaptive evolution is the product of
natural selection, changes in ecological selection pressures are
expected to affect the evolutionary trajectory of phenotypic traits that
facilitate an organism's survival in their habitat. Evolutionary theory
predicts that differing habitats will exert unique ecological selection
pressures on organisms, resulting in associations between ecological and
phenotypic traits. Indeed, species inhabiting differing habitats often
display functional, behavioral, or phenotypic differences, that have
presumably been the result of adaptive diversification in their
respective ecological habitats (Collar et al. 2010; Kaliontzopoulou et
al. 2015; Price et al. 2015; Martinez et al. 2021; Kolmann et al. 2022).
\hfill\break

One possible evolutionary outcome of ecological specialization is that
organisms inhabiting similar environments display common phenotypic
characteristics. When such patterns occur repeatedly (e.g., Losos 1992;
Schluter and McPhail 1992), this convergent evolution is treated as
strong evidence of adaptation. Indeed the ecomorphological paradigm
(sensu Arnold 1983) is predicated, in part, on such cases, which
emphasize the strong association between the phenotypic traits that
organisms display (morphological, behavioral, or physiological), and the
ecological characteristics of their habitat that mediate organismal
performance. In vertebrates, ecomorphological trends have been well
studied in numerous taxonomic groups, and include the emblematic
`ecomorphs' of Caribbean \emph{Anolis} lizards that exploit different
microhabitats (Losos 1992, 2009; Mahler et al. 2013), differential beak
morphology in species of Darwin's finches (Schluter and Grant 1984;
Grant and Grant 2006; Reaney et al. 2020), the recurring phenotypes of
African lake cichlids across ecological regimes (Albertson and Kocher
2001; Urban et al. 2022), and the distinct body forms of freshwater
fishes in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{benthic }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{benthis }\DIFaddend and limnetic habitats (Jastrebski and Robinson 2004;
Berner et al. 2008; Stuart et al. 2017) among others. \hfill\break

However, while the patterns of morphological differences in distinct
ecological contexts have been well documented, less-well understood is
how this differentiation has been influenced by the covariance between
body parts resulting from body size variation (i.e., allometry). It has
long been recognized that the interrelationships among traits can have a
strong influence on how phenotypic evolution proceeds, as trait
correlations influence the degree to which phenotypic variation is
exposed to selection (Wagner and Altenberg 1996). Thus, the integration
among traits can constrain phenotypic change in certain directions, or
enhance variation along other phenotypic axes (Schluter 1996; Wagner and
Altenberg 1996; Wagner and Zhang 2011; Klingenberg and Marugán-Lobón
2013; Goswami et al. 2014, 2016; Felice et al. 2018\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; Navalón et al.
2020}\DIFdelend ). Further, because
nearly all linear traits covary strongly with overall body size
(Jolicoeur 1963; Bookstein 2022), allometric trends could be considered
the quintessential measure of phenotypic integration. Thus, identifying
whether allometric patterns differ across habitats, and how such
patterns of trait covariation affect ecomorphological trends among
species utilizing those habitats, remains an important \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{understudied
}\DIFaddend question worthy of investigation. \hfill\break

The Afro-Arabian geckos in the genus \emph{Pristurus} afford the
opportunity to elucidate the interdigitating effects of allometry and
habitat specialization on clade-level patterns of phenotypic diversity.
Prior work on this system (Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2021a) revealed that
the colonization of ground habitats has been a trigger of morphological
change, specifically reflected in an increase in body size and shape
disparity. Interestingly, some ground-dwelling species are among the
largest of the genus and also show increased relative head sizes and
limb proportions, while some other species with this ecological
specialization have evolved to be among the smallest of the group.
Additionally, among the species exploiting rocky habitats (the most
common ecological feature in \emph{Pristurus}), there are also species
with both considerably large and small body sizes (Tejero-Cicuéndez et
al. 2021a). What remains unexplored, however, is how the evolution of
body shape is related to differences in body size and whether habitat
specialization has an impact in this shape-size relationship.
\hfill\break

In this study, we employed a combination of multivariate morphometric
and phylogenetic comparative analysis to interrogate macroevolutionary
patterns of evolutionary allometry in \emph{Pristurus} geckos of
Afro-Arabia. Using phenotypic, phylogenetic, and ecological data, we
first characterized allometric trends in body form in the group, to
discern the extent to which allometric patterns differed across species
occupying distinct ecological habitats. We then examined changes in
allometric trends across the phylogeny, and linked these patterns to
overall phenotypic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{integration, }\DIFdelend diversification in morphospace, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{habitat utilization among taxa}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in relation to
habitat utilization}\DIFaddend . Overall our results demonstrate that the interplay
between ecological specialization and differing allometric trajectories
in species with disparate body size may have a determinant role in
shaping the phenotypic evolution and hence in adaptive dynamics \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in this clade }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at the
clade level}\DIFaddend .

\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

We used a combination of phenotypic, phylogenetic, and ecological data
to characterize and evaluate intra- and interspecific allometric trends.
The data utilized here were obtained from our prior work on this system
(Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2021a, 2022), and are briefly described here.
First we used a time-dated, molecular phylogeny that included all
members of the genus \emph{Pristurus}, including several currently
undescribed taxa. The tree was estimated in a Bayesian framework, using
five mitochondrial markers, six nuclear markers, and 21 calibration
points (for details see Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2022). Next we
categorized each species as belonging to one of three ecological groups
(ground, rock, or tree), based on descriptions of habitat use found in
the literature (see Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2021a). Finally, we obtained
a phenotypic data set containing body size (snout-vent length: SVL) and
eight linear measurements (Figure 1) that described overall body form:
trunk length (TrL), head length (HL), head width (HW), head height (HH),
humerus length (Lhu), ulna length (Lun), femur length (Lfe), and tibia
length (Ltb) (Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2021a). We restricted our study to
those species represented by nine or more individuals; resulting in a
dataset of 687 individuals from 25 species (invidivuals per species:
\(\mu=27\); min = 9, max = 56). Species in the phenotypic dataset were
then matched to the phylogeny, which was subsequently pruned to arrive
at the final topology. All measurements were log-transformed prior to
statistical analyses. Additional details regarding data collection and
formal descriptions of each linear measurement may be found in the
original sources (see Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2021a, 2022). The data are
found on DRYAD: \url{https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.xwdbrv1f6}
(Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2021b).

\subsection{Statistical and Comparative
Analyses}\label{statistical-and-comparative-analyses}}

We conducted a series of analyses to interrogate allometric trends \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{,
patterns of integration, }\DIFdelend and
macroevolutionary changes in allometry, relative to differentiation in
body form. First we characterized evolutionary allometry in the genus by
performing a phylogenetic multivariate regression of body form on size,
using the species means as data. We then performed an analogous
procedure at the individual level, regressing body form on size using
our entire dataset. From both the species-level (phylogenetic) and the
individual-level regression models, we obtained the set of regression
coefficients, and calculated the difference between them to describe the
extent to which patterns of allometry at the individual level were
concordant with evolutionary allometric trends across species.
\hfill\break

Next we used the individual dataset to determine whether allometric
trends in body form differed across habitat groups. This was
accomplished by performing a multivariate analysis of covariance, with
body size (\(SVL\)), \(habitat\), and \(SVL\times habitat\) as model
effects. Significance was evaluated using 999 iterations of a
permutation procedure, where residuals from a reduced model were
randomly permuted in each permutation (RRPP), model statistics were
recalculated, and used to generate empirical null sampling distributions
to evaluate the observed test statistics (following Freedman and Lane
1983; Collyer and Adams 2007; Collyer et al. 2015). We then compared the
multivariate allometric vectors for each habitat group by calculating
pairwise differences in their angular direction in morphospace, and
evaluating these relative to empirical sampling distributions obtained
through RRPP (Collyer and Adams 2007; Adams and Collyer 2009; Collyer
and Adams 2013). Patterns of multivariate allometry relative to body
size were visualized via regression scores (Drake and Klingenberg 2008)
and predicted lines (Adams and Nistri 2010), based on the coefficients
and fitted values from the linear model described above. \hfill\break

We then examined changes in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the size-corrected body shape proportions
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{allometric trends }\DIFaddend across the phylogeny. Here
we treated the head dimensions and limb dimensions separately, as
allometric trends could potentially differ between these body regions
due to differential functional or selective constraints (Kaliontzopoulou
et al. 2010). Because both the head and limb data were multivariate, we
first performed a partial least squares \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(PLS) }\DIFdelend analysis (Rohlf and Corti 2000)
of the head traits versus SVL, and the limb traits versus SVL, to
describe the direction of maximal covaration between each body region
and size. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Then, we measured the mean
residuals of each species to the allometric trend inferred, which show
if head and limbs proportions of species are greater or smaller than
expected for their body size. The species residuals were then mapped on
the phylogeny of }\emph{\DIFdel{Pristurus}} %DIFAUXCMD

\DIFdel{Furthermore, we examined the relationship between evolutionary and
static allometry. Species-specific }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{PLS scores from each analysis were obtained, and
species-specific }\DIFaddend slopes describing the extent of head and limb allometry

\(PLS1_{limb} \sim SVL*species\) respectively. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend species-specific

shifts in allometry across the phylogeny for the group }\DIFaddend (for a similar
approach see Adams and Nistri 2010). \hfill\break

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Next, because allometry describes the extent to which traits covary with
size and with each other (i.e., integration), we conducted an analysis
of integration. Here we characterized the extent of morphological
integration in body form for individuals within each habitat group.
Integration was estimated by summarizing he dispersion of eigenvalues of
the trait covariance matrix (sensu Pavlicev et al. 2009). This measure
(\(V_{rel}\)) was subsequently converted to an effect size (a
\(Z\)-score), which quantified the strength of morphological integration
(see Conaway and Adams 2022). We then performed a series of two-sample
tests to compare the strength of morphological integration across
habitat groups. Additionally and for comparison, we repeated these
analyses on the set of size-standardized trait data, found as a set of
shape ratios (sensu Mosimann 1970) where each trait was divided by body
size (Supplemental Information). }%DIFDELCMD < \hfill\break
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend Finally, to relate within-species allometric trends with patterns of
phenotypic diversification in the group we generated a phylomorphospace,
based on the size-standardized species means obtained from a
phylogenetic regression (see Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2021a). Here,
phenotypic similarities among species, relative to their phylogenetic
relationships and habitat affiliations, were observed. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A similar
phylomorphospace was constructed for species means not corrected for
body size, and the phenotypic disparity among species means in each
habitat was calculated and subsequently compared (Supplemental
Information). }\DIFdelend All analyses were
conducted in R 4.2.1 (R Core Team 2022), using \texttt{RRPP} version
1.3.1 (Collyer and Adams 2018; Collyer and Adams 2022)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\texttt{\DIFdel{geomorph}} %DIFAUXCMD

\section{Results}\label{results}}

Using phylogenetic regression, we found significant evolutionary
allometry in body form across species (\(N_{sp}=25\); \(F = 217.9\);

examined across individuals, a similar pattern was observed
(\(N_{ind}=687\); \(F = 7910.8\); \(Z =9.20\); \(P < 0.001\)). Further,
the vectors of regression coefficients between the two analyses were
highly correlated (\(\rho = 0.94\)) and were oriented in nearly parallel
directions in morphospace (\(\theta = 1.49^\circ\)). This revealed that
the pattern of multivariate allometry across individuals was concordant
with macroevolutionary trends of interspecific allometry among species
of \emph{Pristurus} across the phylogeny. \hfill\break

Our analyses also exposed significant differences in the allometry of
body form among \emph{Pristurus} utilizing distinct habitats (Table 1).
Here, comparisons of multivariate allometric vectors identified that
ground-dwelling \emph{Pristurus} displayed a distinct allometric trend
as compared with \emph{Pristurus} occupying both the rock and tree
habitats (Table 2). In addition, allometric patterns in both rock and
tree habitats were similar to the multivariate line of isometry (Figure
2), while patterns of multivariate allometry in ground-dwelling
\emph{Pristurus} was decidely steeper. Inspection of the regression
coefficients for each trait (Supplemental Information) confirmed the
steeper allometric coefficients for all head and limb traits in
ground-dwelling \emph{Pristurus} as compared with rock and tree-dwelling
taxa, corroborating this result. Taken together, these findings implied
that larger individuals of ground-dwelling \emph{Pristurus} species
displayed proportionately larger heads and limbs, as compared with large
individuals in taxa utilizing other habitat types. A visualization of
multivariate allometric trends (Figure 2) confirmed these statistical
findings, and indicated that the allometric trajectory in
ground-dwelling animals was more extreme as compared with either rock or
tree-dwelling \emph{Pristurus}. \hfill\break

Inspection of traitgrams thus revealed some degree of discordance in
patterns of allometry across body regions; a pattern evidenced by the
relatively low correlation between slopes representing head and limb
allometry respectively (\(\rho = 0.42\)). \hfill\break

\DIFdel{The relationship between certain phenotypic traits and the organisms'

essential to understand how natural selection operates. In this study,
we evaluated the role of potential drivers of body shape differentiation
in the geckos of the genus }\emph{\DIFdel{Pristurus}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{. In particular, we
investigated how the interplay of ecological specialization, phenotypic
integration and allometric trends have shaped the morphological
evolution in this radiation of Afro-Arabian geckos. Our results show
that allometric trends and integration patterns are different across
habitats, with ground-dwelling species having the steepest multivariate
allometric slope and also the strongest morphological integration. These
patterns are also different across body parts, with decoupled trends
between head and limb proportions. Additionally, we found that changes
in static allometric trends are not restricted to specific regions of
the phylogeny, but rather they show multiple independent increases and
decreases following common dynamics within habitat groups. Overall,
these results suggest that the interplay between allometric and
integration patterns is a fundamental factor to explain the
morphological evolution across a variety of habitats, which is
consistent with the theoretical expectation that different ecological
contexts impose distinct selective pressures triggering phenotypic
change.

patterns in the literature, with an often uncertain distinction between
allometry as an evolutionary constraint and allometry as functional
optimization resulting from natural selection (Pélabon et al.~2014, Voje

\DIFdel{Similarly, when analyzing patterns of morphological integration, we
found important differences among habitat groups: ground-dwelling
species present the strongest integration, which in turn is weakest in
arboreal species. Morphological integration occurs when different body
parts coevolve, and has been suggested as an evolutionary constraint,
since it restricts the specific lines along which integrated structures
are allowed to vary (}\textbf{\DIFdel{REF}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{). Weaker integration levels (i.e.,
modularity), on the contrary, might facilitate morphological evolution
by allowing a less constrained exploration of the morphospace(}\textbf{\DIFdel{REF}}%DIFAUXCMD

potential driver of morphological change, since it may provide a
phenotypic pathway through adaptive lines of least resistance that
enable rapid evolutionary processes (Navalón et al. 2020). In this
context, our results on allometry and integration suggest that patterns
of trait covariation are more constrained in ground-dwelling species,
such that their differences in body form are most likely found along
this primary axis. The fact that ground species in }\emph{\DIFdel{Pristurus}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{have
been found to have the widest phenotypic disparity and highest rates of
morphological evolution (Tejero-Cicuéndez et al.~2021) is consistent

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Another insightful result is the low correlation between head and limbs

different parts of an organism are subjected to different functional
pressures (e.g., head evolution might be mainly influenced by diet while
limb evolution might respond more tightly to the substrate used by the
species), resulting in a decoupling of their respective morphological
change. Ultimately, the combination of selective pressures upon which
organisms evolve may lead to differential levels of integration across
different body parts, with certain structures coevolving in a similar
(i.e., integrated) manner and others in a segregated (i.e., modular)
way. This, in turn, may have fundamental implications for the extent of
morphological diversification within clades, and can be key to describe
the phenotypic divergence observed across the tree of life. Future and
