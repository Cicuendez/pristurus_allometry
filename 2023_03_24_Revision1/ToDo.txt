
### UPDATE SI SCRIPT FOR RDF2

Table 1:
"Note that there is no variation explained by the 'habitat' term, as the pooled-within species data are mean-centered."

### WORDING CHANGES
"This method partials out the effects of species differences while retaining the within-species patterns of variation and allometry"
