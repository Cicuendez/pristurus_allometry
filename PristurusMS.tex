some general paragraph on the evolution of phenotypic diversity
\hfill\break

when organisms colonize new and unique habitats, they are subjected to
novel ecological selection pressures in those habitats. Often these
selective pressures elicit changes in body form, as organisms adapt to
their new habitats (examples: some comment on ecomorphs, etc.). \ldots.
leads to so-called ecomorphs, with such well known examples in Anolis
lizards, cichlid fishes, etc. It follows that \ldots{} Some comment on
the fact that clades living in diverse ecological conditions often
display greater diversity in form and function (REFS).

However, while the above patterns have been well documented in a variety
of vertebrate taxa, what remains less known is how allometry plays a
role in this phenotypic diversification. We know that XYZPDQ (about
allometry). Then links to diversity..

The Afro-Arabian geckos in the genus \emph{Pristurus} afford the
opportunity to elucidate the interdigitating effects of allometry and
habitat specialization on clade-level patterns of phenotypic diversity.
Prior work on this system (Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2021a) has revealed
that \ldots{} (sentence or 2 about your prior study, getting to

\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

For this study, we combined phenotypic, phylogenetic, and ecological
data to evaluate macroevolutionary trends in allometry in
\emph{Pristurus} geckos, and to discern the extent to which those
patterns differed across species occupying distinct ecological habitats.
The data were obtained from our prior work on this system
(Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2021a, 2022), and are briefly described here.
First we used a time-dated, molecular phylogeny that included all
members of the genus \emph{Pristurus}, including several currently
undescribed taxa. The tree was estimated in a Bayesian framework, using
five mitochondrial markers, six nuclear markers, and 21 calibration
points (for details see Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2022). Next we
categorized each species as belonging to one of three ecological groups
(ground, rock, or tree), based on descriptions of habitat use found in
the literature (see Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2021a). Finally, we obtained
a phenotypic data set containing body size (snout-vent length: SVL) and
eight linear measurements (Figure 1) that described overall body form:
trunk length (TrL), head length (HL), head width (HW), head height (HH),
humerus length (Lhu), ulna length (Lun), femur length (Lfe), and tibia
length (Ltb) (Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2021a). We restricted our study to
those species represented by five or more individuals; resulting in a
dataset of 687 individuals from 25 species (invidivuals per species:
\(\mu=27\); min = 9, max = 56). Species in the phenotypic dataset were
then matched to the phylogeny, which was subsequently pruned to arrive
at the final topology. All measurements were log-transformed prior to
statistical analyses. Additional details regarding data collection and
formal descriptions of each linear measurement may be found in the
original sources (see Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2021a, 2022). The data are
found on DRYAD: \url{https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.xwdbrv1f6}
(Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2021b).

\subsection{Statistical and Comparative
Analyses}\label{statistical-and-comparative-analyses}}

We conducted a series of analyses to interrogate allometric trends and
macroevolutionary changes in allometry, relative to diversification in
body form. First, to determine whether allometric trends in body form
differed across habitat groups, we performed a multivariate analysis of
covariance, with body size (\(SVL\)), \(habitat\), and
\(SVL\times habitat\) as model effects. Significance was evaluated using
999 iterations of a permutation procedure, where residuals from a
reduced model were randomly permuted in each permutation (RRPP), model
statistics were recalculated, and used to generate empirical null
sampling distributions to evaluate the observed test statistics
(following Freedman and Lane 1983; Collyer and Adams 2007; Collyer et
al. 2015). Next we compared the multivariate allometric vectors for each
habitat group by calculating pairwise differences in their angular
direction in morphospace, and evaluating these relative to empirical
sampling distributions obtained through RRPP (Collyer and Adams 2007;
Adams and Collyer 2009; Collyer and Adams 2013). We then visualized
patterns of multivariate allometry relative to body size via regression
scores (Drake and Klingenberg 2008) and predicted lines (Adams and
Nistri 2010), based on the coefficients and fitted values from the
linear model described above. \hfill\break

Second, we examined changes in allometric trends across the phylogeny,
treating the head dimensions and limb dimensions separately. Because
both the head and limb data were multivariate, we accomplished this by
first performing a partial least squares analysis (Rohlf and Corti 2000)
of the head traits versus SVL, and the limb traits versus SVL, and
retaining the PLS scores for each individual from the first dimension of
this analysis. Species-specific slopes describing the extent of head and
limb allometry within each species were then obtained from an analysis
of covariance modeled as: \(PLS1_{head} \sim SVL*species\) and
\(PLS1_{limb} \sim SVL*species\) respectively. Species' slopes were then
mapped on the phylogeny of \emph{Pristurus} using a Brownian motion
model of evolution, to qualitatively evaluate shifts in allometry across
species (for a similar approach see Adams and Nistri 2010). \hfill\break

Finally, to relate within-species allometric trends with patterns of
phenotypic diversification in the group we generated a phylomorphospace,
based on the size-standardized species means obtained from a
phylogenetic regression (see Tejero-Cicuéndez et al. 2021a). Here,
phenotypic similarities among species, relative to their phylogenetic
relationships and habitat affiliations, were observed. All analyses were
conducted in R 4.2.1 (R Core Team 2022), using \texttt{RRPP} version
1.3.1 (Collyer and Adams 2018; Collyer and Adams 2022), and scripts
written by the authors (available at \textbf{XXX}).

\section{Results}\label{results}}

Our analyses revealed significant differences in the allometry of body
form among \emph{Pristurus} that utilized distinct habitats (Table 1).
Further, comparisons of multivariate allometric vectors identified that
ground-dwelling \emph{Pristurus} displayed a distinct allometric trend
as compared with \emph{Pristurus} occupying both the rock and tree
habitats (Table 2). A visualization of multivariate allometric trends
(Fig. 2) confirmed these statistical findings, and indicated that the
allometric trajectory in rock-dwelling animals was more extreme as
compared with either ground or tree-dwelling \emph{Pristurus}.
Inspection of individual regression coefficients for each trait
(Supplemental Information) further corroborated this, revealing steeper
allometric coefficients for all head and limb traits in ground-dwelling
\emph{Pristurus} as compared with rock and tree-dwelling taxa. Overall,
these findings revealed that larger individuals of ground-dwelling
\emph{Pristurus} species displayed proportionately larger heads and
limbs, as compared with large individuals in taxa utilizing other
habitat types. \hfill\break

Ground: head and body dimensions are more positively allometric
(relative to SVL) than in rock/tree groups, and whereas allometric
coefficients more similar in rock \& tree.

Formally evaluated using PLS: confirming \ldots\ldots. WHen mapped on
the phylogeny (\ldots.) Here traitgrams (by SVL) elucidated that heads
more strongly allometric in XXX, implying that larger individuals of
these species display proportionately larger heads relative to the
`typical' trend in the genus. By contrast, \ldots{} less strong
